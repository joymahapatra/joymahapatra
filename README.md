## "Hey, there! ðŸŒ±" (â€”copied from [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)))
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm <ins>Joy Mahapatra</ins>, and my primary area of interest focuses on *irregularities* in statistical models (e.g., automated text generation models).
This space will be regularly (ðŸ˜‰) updated with details about my projects and thoughts. 
Thanks for visiting!
